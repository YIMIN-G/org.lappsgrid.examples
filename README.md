# Introduction

This part contains a brief introduction to LAPPS Exchange Data Structures (LEDS), a guide to use LAPPS Serialization package for compatible I/O operations of a service, and finally how to implement 'getMetadata()' method, a requirement for a LAPPS service.

# Requirements

For this tutorial you will require:

1. Java 1.7
1. Maven 3.0.x
1. An IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse
1. About 15 minues

It is assumed that you know how to create a Maven project either using your IDE or via the command line.  Maven usage is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

# Up Next

In Step four of the tutorial, we will implement another required method, 'execute()'.

To advance to step two run the command:

```bash
> git checkout Step3-Execute
```
